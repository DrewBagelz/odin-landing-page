# odin-landing-page
Landing Page project for The Odin Project's Foundations course

## Overview
A simple mock webpage with a header, footer, and three body 
sections.

## Reflections
I had a hard time with the CSS exercises from the previous lesson, 
so I wasn't feeling too confident going into this project. 
Fortunately, my worries were unfounded and I was able to construct
the landing page without too much trouble. The one thing I couldn't 
figure out was how to turn the text in the quote section to light 
italics. I couldn't get it as thin as I wanted with the `font-weight`
property.
